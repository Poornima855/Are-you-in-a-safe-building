## Image Classification Model (5-Class | PyTorch)

This repository contains an image classification model built using **Python** and **PyTorch**, capable of classifying images into **five distinct categories**. It includes training, evaluation, visualization, and supports GPU acceleration using CUDA 12.4 and cuDNN.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ 5-class image classification using pretrained CNNs (ResNet, VGG)
- 🧪 Full training & validation pipeline
- 🎯 Accuracy metrics + confusion matrix
- 🧠 Transfer learning & fine-tuning support
- 📊 Visualization of loss & accuracy over epochs
- 💾 Model saving and loading
- ⚡ Optimized for GPU via CUDA 12.4 + cuDNN

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install CUDA and cuDNN (for GPU users)

- Download and install [CUDA Toolkit 12.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
- Download and install [cuDNN (compatible with CUDA 12.4)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Poornima855/Are-you-in-a-safe-building_Imgae_Classifier_Model.git

cd Are-you-in-a-safe-building_Image_Classifier_Model

### 2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirementsF_1.txt

## 📁 Dataset 

The dataset is hosted externally 🔗 Download from [here](https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/poornima2024_iisc_ac_in/EnOnM11aD3hFghQap5JmZQ8B8SZDaR3iUvYZgtIjwoeeew?e=WZGeDo)

## 📌 Notes
The model is designed for images sized 400x300 (width x height).

GPU is highly recommended for faster training.

You can easily switch to other pretrained models (EfficientNet, MobileNet, etc.) with minimal changes.
