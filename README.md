## 🚀 Features

- ✅ 5-class image classification using pretrained CNNs (ResNet, VGG)
- 🧪 Full training & validation pipeline
- 🎯 Accuracy metrics + confusion matrix
- 🧠 Transfer learning & fine-tuning support
- 📊 Visualization of loss & accuracy over epochs
- 💾 Model saving and loading
- ⚡ Optimized for GPU via CUDA 12.4 + cuDNN

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install CUDA and cuDNN (for GPU users)

- Download and install [CUDA Toolkit 12.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
- Download and install [cuDNN (compatible with CUDA 12.4)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

cd your-repo-name

### 2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirementsF_1.txt

## 📁 Dataset 

The dataset is hosted externally 🔗 Download from [here](https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/poornima2024_iisc_ac_in/Enh7eT8L3UlEhkTQlI2bGw8BsK1-xF40S8fWSiROfWKzLQ?e=LWHeI9)

## 📌 Notes
The model is designed for images sized 400x300 (width x height).

GPU is highly recommended for faster training.

You can easily switch to other pretrained models (EfficientNet, MobileNet, etc.) with minimal changes.
